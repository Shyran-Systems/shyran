# Serhii Shyran, IC & SA

### Welcome to my Professional Page

I use GitHub to Code, Host & Deliver content to my clients (B2C). 
This Page is also served through [GitHub Pages](https://shyran-systems.github.io/www.shyran.pp.ua/) to maintain contact with Subcontractors, current and potential Clients.

Whenever there is a commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the page, from the content in Markdown file, so information keeps up to date.

### What is Markdown ?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
