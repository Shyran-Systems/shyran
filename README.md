# Serhii Shyran, IC & SA

### Welcome to my Professional Page

I use GitHub to Code, Host & Deliver content to my clients (B2C). 
This Page is also served through [GitHub Pages](https://shyran-systems.github.io/www.shyran.pp.ua/) to maintain contact with Subcontractors, current and potential Clients.

Whenever there is a commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the page, from the content in Markdown file, so information keeps up to date.

### What is Markdown ?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Shyran-Systems/shyran.pp.ua/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
